VizList
=======

An open source scrum board / organizational list implementation written in NodeJS.

## Getting started

Clone the repo, `npm install`, `bower install`, and finally `grunt serve`.

## What's there

* REST API for CRUD of lists
* List structure designer
* Adding / removal of list items
* Changing list item color
* Drag / drop of list items
* Realtime update of list changes across all viewers

## What's not

* Authentication (and by extension private lists)
* Wallboard mode
* DB persistance -- the storage module is currently flat file
* Anything else you might be thinking of -- but should be trivial to add.
* Tests.  Yet.
* Documentation

Pull requests welcome!
